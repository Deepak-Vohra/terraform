(base) deepakvohra@bluesky:~/terraform-provider-platform$ terraform apply -help
Usage: terraform [global options] apply [options] [PLAN]

  Creates or updates infrastructure according to Terraform configuration
  files in the current directory.

  By default, Terraform will generate a new plan and present it for your
  approval before taking any action. You can optionally provide a plan
  file created by a previous call to "terraform plan", in which case
  Terraform will take the actions described in that plan without any
  confirmation prompt.

Options:

  -auto-approve          Skip interactive approval of plan before applying.

  -backup=path           Path to backup the existing state file before
                         modifying. Defaults to the "-state-out" path with
                         ".backup" extension. Set to "-" to disable backup.

  -compact-warnings      If Terraform produces any warnings that are not
                         accompanied by errors, show them in a more compact
                         form that includes only the summary messages.

  -destroy               Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure.
                         The command "terraform destroy" is a convenience alias
                         for this option.

  -lock=false            Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is
                         dangerous if others might concurrently run commands
                         against the same workspace.

  -lock-timeout=0s       Duration to retry a state lock.

  -input=true            Ask for input for variables if not directly set.

  -no-color              If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -parallelism=n         Limit the number of parallel resource operations.
                         Defaults to 10.

  -state=path            Path to read and save state (unless state-out
                         is specified). Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".

  -state-out=path        Path to write state to that is different than
                         "-state". This can be used to preserve the old
                         state.

  If you don't provide a saved plan file then this command will also accept
  all of the plan-customization options accepted by the terraform plan command.
  For more information on those options, run:
      terraform plan -help
(base) deepakvohra@bluesky:~/terraform-provider-platform$ terraform init -help
Usage: terraform [global options] init [options]

  Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory by creating
  initial files, loading any remote state, downloading modules, etc.

  This is the first command that should be run for any new or existing
  Terraform configuration per machine. This sets up all the local data
  necessary to run Terraform that is typically not committed to version
  control.

  This command is always safe to run multiple times. Though subsequent runs
  may give errors, this command will never delete your configuration or
  state. Even so, if you have important information, please back it up prior
  to running this command, just in case.

Options:

  -backend=false          Disable backend or HCP Terraform initialization
                          for this configuration and use what was previously
                          initialized instead.

                          aliases: -cloud=false

  -backend-config=path    Configuration to be merged with what is in the
                          configuration file's 'backend' block. This can be
                          either a path to an HCL file with key/value
                          assignments (same format as terraform.tfvars) or a
                          'key=value' format, and can be specified multiple
                          times. The backend type must be in the configuration
                          itself.

  -force-copy             Suppress prompts about copying state data when
                          initializating a new state backend. This is
                          equivalent to providing a "yes" to all confirmation
                          prompts.

  -from-module=SOURCE     Copy the contents of the given module into the target
                          directory before initialization.

  -get=false              Disable downloading modules for this configuration.

  -input=false            Disable interactive prompts. Note that some actions may
                          require interactive prompts and will error if input is
                          disabled.

  -lock=false             Don't hold a state lock during backend migration.
                          This is dangerous if others might concurrently run
                          commands against the same workspace.

  -lock-timeout=0s        Duration to retry a state lock.

  -no-color               If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -plugin-dir             Directory containing plugin binaries. This overrides all
                          default search paths for plugins, and prevents the
                          automatic installation of plugins. This flag can be used
                          multiple times.

  -reconfigure            Reconfigure a backend, ignoring any saved
                          configuration.

  -migrate-state          Reconfigure a backend, and attempt to migrate any
                          existing state.

  -upgrade                Install the latest module and provider versions
                          allowed within configured constraints, overriding the
                          default behavior of selecting exactly the version
                          recorded in the dependency lockfile.

  -lockfile=MODE          Set a dependency lockfile mode.
                          Currently only "readonly" is valid.

  -ignore-remote-version  A rare option used for HCP Terraform and the remote backend
                          only. Set this to ignore checking that the local and remote
                          Terraform versions use compatible state representations, making
                          an operation proceed even when there is a potential mismatch.
                          See the documentation on configuring Terraform with
                          HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise for more information.

  -test-directory=path    Set the Terraform test directory, defaults to "tests".
