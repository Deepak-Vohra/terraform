Success! The configuration is valid.

deepakvohra@localhost:~/terraform-provider-example/terraform$ terraform plan
example_server.my-server-name: Refreshing state... [id=new environment id]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # example_server.my-server-name will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "example_server" "my-server-name" {
        id             = "new environment id"
      ~ name           = "a platform env" -> "updated env"
        # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
