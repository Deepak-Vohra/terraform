deepakvohra@localhost:~/terraform-provider-example/terraform$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # example_server.my-server-name will be created
  + resource "example_server" "my-server-name" {
      + environment_id = "backup_of_main"
      + id             = (known after apply)
      + name           = "a platform env"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
